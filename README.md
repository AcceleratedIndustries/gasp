# GASP - General AI Specialized Process Monitor

**GASP** is a Linux system monitoring tool designed specifically for AI consumption rather than human dashboards. It produces comprehensive, context-rich JSON output that enables AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to diagnose system issues, identify potential problems, and understand system state with minimal queries.

## Project Status

**Current Version:** 0.1.0-dev (MVP in progress)

> ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: This version of GASP has **NO AUTHENTICATION**. It must run on trusted networks behind a firewall. **DO NOT EXPOSE THIS VERSION TO THE INTERNET.** Authentication will be added in an upcoming release.

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ HTTP server with `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/version` endpoints
- ✅ CPU metrics collection (load averages, utilization, trend analysis)
- ✅ Memory metrics collection (usage, swap, pressure indicators)
- ✅ Rich contextual interpretations for all metrics
- ✅ Concurrent collector architecture
- ✅ Health scoring and concern detection
- ✅ **Claude Code skill bundled** - instant AI diagnostics for your infrastructure

**Planned Features:**
- 🔒 **Next up:** Authentication and authorization (API tokens, secure access)
- Disk I/O and usage metrics
- Network statistics and connection tracking
- Process information and top consumers
- Systemd unit monitoring
- Journal log analysis
- Desktop environment support (Hyprland, KDE, GNOME)
- GPU monitoring (NVIDIA/AMD)
- Baseline tracking and anomaly detection

See `AI-Monitor-Project-Specification.md` for the complete specification.

## Quick Start

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/accelerated-industries/gasp
cd gasp

# Build the binary
make build

# Run GASP
./gasp
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

> 💡 **Tip:** After starting GASP, install the bundled Claude Code skill to enable instant AI diagnostics: `claude-code skill install ./skill/gasp-diagnostics.skill`

> ⚠️ **Remember:** This version has no authentication. Run only on trusted networks behind a firewall.

### Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health | jq .

# Version information
curl http://localhost:8080/version | jq .

# Full system metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | jq .
```

## Example Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-15T17:43:46Z",
  "hostname": "hyperion",
  "uptime": "0m",
  "summary": {

## Key Design Principles

1. **AI-First Output:** Rich contextual information optimized for LLM consumption
2. **Interpretation Over Raw Data:** Every metric includes human-readable interpretation
3. **Single Source of Truth:** One comprehensive endpoint containing current state and trends
4. **Low Overhead:** Minimal system impact (<1% CPU, <50MB RAM)
5. **Easy Distribution:** Single static binary with no runtime dependencies

```

### Adding New Collectors

1. Implement the `Collector` interface in `internal/collectors/`
2. Add collection logic reading from `/proc` or `/sys`
3. Include interpretation and trend analysis
4. Register the collector in `cmd/gasp/main.go`

See `internal/collectors/cpu.go` or `memory.go` for examples.

## Configuration

Currently GASP uses command-line flags:

```bash
./gasp --port 8080              # Set HTTP port (default: 8080)
./gasp --config /path/to/config # Load config file (not yet implemented)
./gasp --version                # Show version and exit
```

Configuration file support is planned for Phase 2.

## Architecture

GASP uses a **collector-based architecture** with concurrent metric gathering:

1. Multiple specialized collectors (CPU, Memory, Disk, etc.)
2. Each collector implements a common interface
3. Collectors run concurrently using goroutines
4. Results aggregated into a SystemSnapshot
5. Served via HTTP JSON API

Different metrics are collected at different rates:
- **High-frequency (10s):** CPU, memory, load
- **Medium-frequency (30s):** Processes, network, disk I/O (planned)
- **Low-frequency (5m):** Logs, systemd units (planned)

## Performance Targets

- Binary size: < 15MB
- Memory footprint: < 50MB
- CPU overhead: < 1% (idle), < 5% (during collection)
- HTTP response time: < 100ms
- Collection cycle: < 2 seconds

## Target Platforms

**Primary Support (Phase 1):**
- Arch Linux (workstations)
- Debian/Ubuntu (servers)

**Future Support:**
- Proxmox VE
- Docker/container hosts
- Raspberry Pi / ARM devices

## AI Integration

### Claude Code Skill (Included!)

GASP includes a **ready-to-use Claude Code skill** that enables instant, intelligent system diagnostics. Once GASP is running on your systems, Claude Code can automatically fetch metrics and provide expert-level analysis of your infrastructure.

#### Installing the Skill

```bash
# From the GASP repository root
claude-code skill install ./skill/gasp-diagnostics.skill
```

Once installed, Claude Code can diagnose any GASP-enabled host on your network:

**Natural language diagnostics:**
- "Check hyperion for me"
- "What's wrong with accelerated.local?"
- "Compare my proxmox nodes"
- "Is the dev server having memory issues?"
- "Why is 192.168.1.100 slow?"

#### What the Skill Does

The `gasp-diagnostics` skill empowers Claude Code to:

1. **Automatically fetch** metrics from any GASP-enabled host via HTTP
2. **Intelligently analyze** system state using metric correlation and baselines
3. **Identify issues** with context-aware pattern recognition (dev workstation vs server vs VM host)
4. **Provide actionable recommendations** specific to the detected problem
5. **Compare multiple hosts** to identify outliers and correlated issues
6. **Understand system context** (desktop environments, container hosts, GPU workloads, etc.)

**Example interaction:**
```
You: Check accelerated.local
Claude: Fetching metrics from accelerated.local...

Issue detected: Memory pressure at 8.2%. The postgres container started
swapping 2 hours ago and is now using 12GB RAM (up from 4GB baseline).
This likely indicates a query leak.

Recommendation: Check recent queries and consider restarting the container.
```

The skill handles network topology automatically - works with mDNS (.local), DNS names, and IP addresses on your trusted network.

#### Security Note for the Skill

The skill connects to GASP instances on port 8080 by default. Since this version has no authentication, ensure:
- GASP runs only on trusted internal networks
- Firewall rules prevent external access to port 8080
- You trust all hosts on the network where GASP is deployed

### Direct API Usage

For non-Claude AI agents or custom integrations:

```bash
# Fetch metrics via curl
curl -s http://hyperion:8080/metrics | jq .

# Multi-host collection script
for host in hyperion proxmox1 proxmox2; do
  curl -s http://${host}:8080/metrics > /tmp/${host}.json
done
```

### Future: MCP Server
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is planned to provide even deeper integration with AI tools beyond Claude Code.

- **Historical data API** - Time-series metrics for trend analysis
- **Alert webhooks** - Proactive notifications for critical issues
- **Integration guides** - Documentation for other AI frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.)

### Future Considerations
- Web UI for human consumption (low priority - AI-first focus maintained)
- Plugin system for custom collectors
- Remote host monitoring (agent-based deployment)
- Kubernetes/container orchestration integration
- Windows support (significant undertaking)

> **Note:** This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and emerging requirements. The priority is to maintain GASP's core philosophy: AI-first monitoring with rich contextual output.
